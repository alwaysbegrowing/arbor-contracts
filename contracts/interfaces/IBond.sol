            the collateralRatio. In addition to covering the collateralRatio,

            have enough convertibleTokens in the contract to the totalSupply of
            Bonds as well. That means even if all of the Bonds were covered by

            the totalSupply of outstanding Bonds. At the maturity date, however,
